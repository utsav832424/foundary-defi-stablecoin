 * @title DSCEngine
 * @author Utsav Bhikadiya
 *
 * The system is designed to be as minimal as possible, and have the tokens maintain a 1 token == $1 peg.
 * This stablecoin has the properties:
 * - Exogenous Collateral
 * - Dollar Pegged
 * - Algoritmically Stable
 *
 * It is similar to DAI if DAI had no governance, no fees, and was only backed by WETH and WBTC.
 *
 * Our DSC System sholud always be "overcollateralized". At no point, should the value of all collateral <= the $ backed value of all the DSC.
 *
 * @notice This contract is the core of the DSC System. It handles all the logic for mining and redeeming DSC, as well as depositing & withdrawing collateral.
 * @notice This contract is VERY loosely based on the MakerDAO DSS (DAI) system.
